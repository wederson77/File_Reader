<h1>In this code, I propose that:</h1>

<h3> - Open a text file (`input.txt`) located in the root directory.</h3>
<h3> - Read the lines from the file until an empty line is encountered.</h3>
<h3> - Collect these lines into a vector.</h3>
<h3> - Print the collected lines in reverse order.</h3>
<h3> - Handle file reading errors appropriately, displaying detailed error messages.</h3>
